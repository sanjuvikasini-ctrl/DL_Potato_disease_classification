# Potato_disease_classification
The aim of the project is to classify the input leaf image into one of the 3 classes : Healthy, late blight and early blight
The following steps were followed :
1. Importing the dataset into tensorflow object
2. Visualization of the dataset
3. Splitting of the input dataset into training set, test set and validation set
4. Data preprocessing - Includes image resizing and data augmentation
5. Defining the CNN model architecture
6. Model compilation
7. Model evaluation on training set and validation set
8. Model prediction on test images
Results : A validation accuracy of 98.44% and test accuracy of 98.6% was achieved
